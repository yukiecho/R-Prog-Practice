# Matrices can be created with the matrix() function. You should supply the values as the first argument and specify the dimensions with the nrow and  ncol arguments. For example, matrix(c(-0.5, 0.5), nrow = 1, ncol = 2) creates a matrix with one row and two columns. By default, the matrix is filled column by column, but you can fill the matrix row by row by setting byrow = TRUE.

# Straight lines can be added to a plot with the abline() function. You can use the argument h to specify the y-values of horizontal lines, and the argument  v to specify the x-values of vertical lines. For example, abline(h = 0) adds a horizontal line at 0.# Add lines
abline(h = mu_y, v = mu_x)
# Add a vertical line that indicates the mean of X and a horizontal line that indicates the mean of Y.
